## Our Mission

Driven by the principle that solidarity brings out the best in individuals, Reach4Help is a global volunteer-run initiative developing technologies to bridge the gap between people in need and mutual aid networks that can help.

<br />

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, commmunities have been left torn without access to necessities such as food and medical supplies, especially in [low-income areas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas/).

<br />

Inspired by the altruism of groups providing donations and delivery services such as the [Outremont COVID-19 Help Foundation](http://outremontcovid19.com/) in Quebec, we're working with existing mutual aid networks to reach more people in need and to mobilize volunteer help more efficiently.

<br />

Through development of open-source and accessible tools for volunteers and people in need alike, we aim to build a large-scale network of help to keep us stronger and more interconnected during this current pandemic and beyond.

<br />

**Our goal** is to ensure that anyone, anywhere can **reach for help**.
